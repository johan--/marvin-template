> **Note:** This integration uses a standalone Python bot process. For a more modern approach to mobile access, see `docs/patterns/mobile-access.md` (coming in a future release). This integration still works but is considered legacy.

# Telegram Integration

Connect MARVIN to Telegram for a full AI assistant experience on mobile.

## What It Does

- **Chat with MARVIN** - Full conversational AI via Telegram
- **Read/write files** - Access your MARVIN workspace from anywhere
- **Fetch URLs** - Get YouTube transcripts, Reddit posts, articles
- **Search files** - Find content across your notes and documents
- **Send files** - Get documents delivered as Telegram attachments
- **Image analysis** - Send photos for Claude to analyze
- **Conversation history** - Context persists across messages

## Who It's For

Anyone who wants MARVIN accessible from their phone. Perfect for:
- Capturing ideas on the go
- Quick file lookups while away from your desk
- Sending links for MARVIN to process and save
- Mobile-first workflows

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Telegram account
- An Anthropic API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment)

## Setup

```bash
./.marvin/integrations/telegram/setup.sh
```

The script will guide you through:
1. Creating a Telegram bot via BotFather
2. Installing Python dependencies
3. Configuring your bot token
4. Setting up user authorization (optional)

## Running the Bot

After setup, start the bot:

```bash
./.marvin/integrations/telegram/run.sh
```

Or run directly:

```bash
cd .marvin/integrations/telegram
source venv/bin/activate
python telegram_bot.py
```

**Tip:** Run the bot in a terminal tab, tmux session, or as a background process to keep it available.

## Try It

After setup, message your bot on Telegram:

- "What's in my current state?"
- "Search for meeting notes from last week"
- "Save this to my inbox: [your idea]"
- Send a YouTube link - "Summarize this video"
- Send a photo - "What's in this image?"
- "Send me the file at content/notes.md"

## Bot Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Introduction and capabilities |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/status` | Check bot status |
| `/save [topic]` | Save conversation summary to session log |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in `.env` or your environment:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Bot token from BotFather |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Anthropic API key |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | **Yes** | Comma-separated user IDs for authorization |

### User Authorization (Required)

**This bot has full access to your MARVIN workspace.** You MUST specify which Telegram users are allowed to use it.

To find your Telegram user ID:
1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. It will reply with your numeric user ID

Then configure authorization:
1. Add to `.env`: `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789`
2. Multiple users: `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321`

The bot will refuse to start without authorized users configured.

## Danger Zone

This integration has **full access** to your MARVIN workspace:

| Action | Risk Level | Who's Affected |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Write/overwrite files | **High** | Your local workspace |
| Read any file | **Medium** | Could expose sensitive data |
| Fetch URLs | Low | No external impact |

### Security Model

- **Mandatory authorization** - Bot requires `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` to start
- **Path sandboxing** - All file operations restricted to MARVIN workspace
- **Symlink protection** - Symlinks pointing outside workspace are blocked
- **Access logging** - Unauthorized access attempts are logged with user ID
- **Error sanitization** - Internal paths not exposed in error messages

### Security Recommendations

1. **Keep your bot token secret** - Anyone with the token can receive messages
2. **Limit authorized users** - Only add users you trust completely
3. **Review the logs** - Check for unauthorized access attempts
4. **Don't store secrets in workspace** - The bot can read any file in your MARVIN directory
5. **Run on trusted network** - The bot communicates with Telegram servers

## Troubleshooting

**"Unauthorized" when messaging the bot**
- Check that your user ID is in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`
- Run `/status` to verify your user ID

**Bot not responding**
- Ensure the bot process is running
- Check that `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid

**"Could not fetch transcript" for YouTube**
- Some videos have transcripts disabled
- Try a different video to verify the feature works

**Python errors on startup**
- Make sure you're using Python 3.10+
- Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Architecture

This integration runs as a standalone Python process (not an MCP server). It:
- Uses the `python-telegram-bot` library for Telegram API
- Calls Claude directly via the Anthropic SDK with tool use
- Stores conversation history in SQLite (`telegram.db`)
- Has access to your MARVIN workspace for file operations

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `telegram_bot.py` | Main bot with Claude integration |
| `content_fetcher.py` | URL content extraction (YouTube, Reddit, etc.) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `setup.sh` | Installation script |
| `run.sh` | Start script |
